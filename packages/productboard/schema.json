You can use a free service like https://webhook.site/ for testing the incoming requests. This service also allows you to define a default response for all incoming requests which is handy to successfully pass the subscription probe. Just click the `Edit` button at the top right of the screen and enter `$request.query.validationtoken$` as the response body (lower case `t` in `validationtoken` is correct).\n\nAn alternative may be https://ngrok.com/ which offers a public URL/IP with a valid HTTPS certificate. It is able to route all incoming requests to your machine in a private network which is really handy during development.\n\n**In any case, be very careful about data security when using such publicly accessible services. Always send there only artificial data for development and testing - you never know, who will be able to access them.**\n\n\n## Firewall\n\nPlease whitelist the following static IP addresses with port 443 on your firewall to be able to receive webhook notifications from the Productboard infrastructure.\n\n- 100.25.97.81\n- 35.174.223.66\n- 52.6.23.216\n\n## Notification delivery\n\nOnce a webhook-triggering event occurs, a task is scheduled for immediate execution to deliver the corresponding notification. Once picked by the notification delivery system, the task is executed, sending a HTTP request to the target URL.\n\n### Error handling\n\nThere are things that can go wrong even before a request reaches its destination (e.g. DNS resolution error, sudden network failure, etc.) and even if it does, the target system may not always be able to correctly process the request. This is why the notification delivery system is built to handle these failures.\n\nOur implementation of the webhook notification sender follows the best practices defined by [RestHooks](https://resthooks.org/docs/retries/) and uses response status as the primary metric for determining whether a request has been successful or not.\n- `200`, `201`, `204` and other `2XX` codes: The request is considered successful and the notification is considered as delivered, no retry is needed.\n- Any other response status or error (such as connection error, timeout, etc.) is handled as an unsuccessful delivery attempt and the task is rescheduled for later.\n\nPlease note that we __do not__ follow redirects and as such any response status in the `3XX` range is understood as a failure. To avoid any potential issues, make sure to use the actual URL of your endpoint when subscribing for webhook notifications.\n\n### Retries\n\nIf a notification delivery task fails, it gets rescheduled for later. We use an exponential backoff strategy to determine how long to wait before attempting the delivery again. The table below shows the wait interval for each failed delivery attempt:\n\n| No. of failed attempts | Next wait time |\n|------------------------|----------------|\n| 1                      | 1 m            |\n| 2                      | 3 m            |\n| 3                      | 9 m            |\n| 4                      | 27 m           |\n| 5                      | 1.35 h         |\n| 6                      | 4.05 h         |\n| 7                      | 12.15 h        |\n| 8                      | 36.45 h        |\n\nIf the delivery fails more than eight times in a row, the task will be removed and the notification will be lost.\n\n## Response Structure\n\nThe response structure for webhooks follows a standard format, but for specific events, additional custom fields are included. Here, we outline the general structure and highlight examples of customized response structures for specific events.\n\n### Standard Response Structure\n\nThe standard webhook response structure includes the following fields:\n  \n  | Field      | Type   |  Description                                           | Always Included |\n  |------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n  | id         | uuid   | The id of the resource that triggered the webhook.     | No              | \n  | eventType  | enum   | The type of event that triggered the webhook.          | Yes             |\n  | link       | object | A JSON object including a link to the relevant target. | Yes             |\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n  \"id\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n  \"eventType\": \"feature.created\",\n  \"link\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://api.productboard.com/features/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Customized Response Structure\n\nFor specific events, we include additional fields in the webhook response to provide more context and relevant data. Each event with a customized response is listed below with the additional custom fields that are included in its response.\n\n#### `feature.updated` Additional Fields\n\n  | Field              | Type             | Description                                           | Always Included |\n  |--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n  | updatedAttributes  | array of strings | The field names on the resource that were updated.    | Yes             |\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n  \"id\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n  \"eventType\": \"feature.updated\",\n  \"link\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://api.productboard.com/features/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n  },\n  \"updatedAttributes\": [\n    \"status\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n"},{"name":"pluginIntegrations","x-displayName":"Plugin integrations","description":"Plugin integrations allow you to add a column to the Productboard Features board which allow for integrations with third-party system. A typical use case is the pushing of features to a ticketing system like Jira. This API is to be used for systems or use cases which are not natively supported by Productboard. A typical flow is as follows:\n1. A POST request is sent to `/plugin-integrations` which will create a new integration/task column in Productboard.  When making the request, you should specify `data.action.url` as the endpoint that will be called when a user clicks on the \"Push button\" on the new integration column. This endpoint must be a service that is publically accessible that can handle HTTP requests. \n2. When the \"Push button\" is clicked, a POST request is sent to the endpoint specified in the previous step. Productboard data is sent to your service which then sends it to the third-party system you would like to integrate with. Generally, the third-party system will respond with data that your service can then return to Productboard.\n3. Your service can take data from the third-party system and make a PUT request to `/plugin-integrations/{id}/connections/{featureId}` to update the status, link, and color of the Push button. This state is called Connection.\n4. The third-party system can change the Connection later using the Plugin Integration Connections API.\n5. In the future we plan to support an unlinking flow from the Productboard UI. The unlinking flow will be similar to linking i.e. when the user clicks on the Unlink button, the third-party system will be notified through the endpoint specified in the Plugin integration.\n\n### Sample workflow of a plugin integration between Productboard and GitLab:\n![sample integration flow](img/sample-integration-flow.png)\n"},{"name":"pluginIntegrationConnections","x-displayName":"Plugin integration connections","description":"Once a Plugin integration is set up, it can be used to interact with the configured 3rd party system. This interaction has a form of clicking a \"push button\" on a Features board. This, in general, notifies the 3rd party system about a user's intention to send feature data from Productboard to that system for processing. The most common use case for this is to bind Productboard feature to some other entity in another system (e.g. a GitLab issue). A result of this operation is what we call _Plugin integration connection_ and it represents a single link between Productboard feature and some other entity.\n\nThere are two ways of creating such a connection:\n  1. via Productboard UI by clicking a push button\n  2. via this API\n\nThe only difference between these two options is in who initiates the operation. The UI gives a Productboard user the ability to create a connection while on the other hand, the API gives the 3rd party system a way of creating a connection on its own.\n\nNote that while we call this thing a \"connection\", it _does not_ mean that every push action necessarily has to bind a feture to some other entity. A \"connection\" can represent whatever you see fit, as long as it makes sense in both Productboard and the other system.\n"},{"name":"jiraIntegrations","x-displayName":"Jira integrations","description":"Jira integrations endpoint allows you to list all configured Jira integrations.

What happens next on Productboard's side is determined by the `state` sent back in the response. For consistency, the semantics of each _state_ are _always_ the same, no matter if the response corresponds to a \"push\", \"unlink\" or \"dismiss\" event.\n\nThe exact semantics are described in detail in the description of [Configure a Plugin integration connection](#operation/putPluginIntegrationConnection) endpoint and apply to this use-case as well. In other words, returning a response to an action notification request __is equivalent__ to sending that exact payload to the [Configure a Plugin integration connection](#operation/putPluginIntegrationConnection) endpoint. This also means that clicking the \"unlink\" button _may not_ actually result in corresponding connection being removed. The 3rd party system is free to return whichever state it sees fit, thus if it really wants to remove the connection, it _needs to_ return the `initial` state to let Productboard know that the connection is to be reset.\n\nEven though the behavior is completely up to the 3rd party system, the following behavior is recommended:\n  - __push__ should switch the connection to the `connected` state. In case of async processing the endpoint should return `progress` state and later set the connection state using the connection API. In case of push error the `error` state should be used.\n  - __unlink__ should switch the connection to the `initial` state\n  - __dismiss__ should switch the connection to the `initial` state\n\nTimeout for the processing and whole end-to-end communication is **5 seconds**. If there is a possibility that your endpoint will take longer time to process an event notification, you should consider to return __In progress__ state immediately and process the request asynchronously. This API easily allows such use-cases, see [this section](#operation/putPluginIntegrationConnection) for details.\n\n**Note on security**: this callback makes use of a security scheme that can be configured by setting the value of `data.action.headers.authorization` when [creating](/#operation/postPluginIntegration) the integration.

This operation notifies Productboard that the 3rd party system tried (or is still trying, depending on the payload type) to establish a connection between Productboard feature and some entity in the other system. There are currently three possible outcomes of such an attempt:\n1. __Connected__: the connection has been established and a push button corresponding to the feature in related Plugin integration should change to represent the connection. This happens when the connection with state `connected` is received in the request body.\n2. __Error__: the connection could not be established and a push button corresponding to the feature in related Plugin integration should change to show the error. This happens connection with state `error` is received in the request body.\n3. __In progress__: the connection is still being created (possibly asynchronously) and a push button corresponding to the feature in related Plugin integration should display an \"in progress\" state. This happens when the state `progress` is received in the request body.\n\nThere is an additional state a connection can be in which does not directly map to an outcome of a push event, the __Initial__ state.

This makes Producboard render an \"in progress\" state on the corresponding push button.\n3.
