## Environment Variables

Eververse uses next-forge's [environment variables](https://docs.next-forge.com/setup/env) architecture to manage secrets, where each package manages its own environment variables. These environment variables are exported and composed into each app's `env.ts` file.

Each relevant app has an `.env.example` file that you can use as a reference. Simply copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the missing values.

## Development

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies with:

```sh Terminal
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server with:

```sh Terminal
pnpm dev
```

Open the localhost URLs with the relevant ports listed above to see the app, e.g.

- [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — The `app` app.
- [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) — The `portal` app.
- [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/) — The `email` app.
- [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/) — The `web` app.
- [http://localhost:3004/](http://localhost:3004/) — The `api` app.
- [http://localhost:3005/](http://localhost:3005/) — The `widget` app.
- [http://localhost:3006/](http://localhost:3006/) — The `docs` app.
- [http://localhost:5005/](http://localhost:5005/) — The `studio` app.
