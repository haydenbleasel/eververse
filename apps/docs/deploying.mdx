description: How to deploy Eververse to Vercel.
---

Eververse is designed to be deployed on Vercel.

To deploy Eververse on Vercel, you need to create 6 new projects:

- `app`
- `api`
- `web`
- `docs`
- `portal`
- `widget`

After selecting your repository, change the Root Directory option to the app of choice e.g. `apps/app`. This should automatically detect the Next.js setup and as such, the build command and output directory.

Then, add all your environment variables to the project. Finally, just hit "Deploy" and Vercel will take care of the rest!

## Environment variables

If you're deploying on Vercel, we recommend making use of the Team Environment Variables feature. Variables used by libraries need to exist in all packages and duplicating them can be a headache. Learn more about how [environment variables](https://docs.next-forge.com/setup/env) work in next-forge.

## Integrations

Eververse makes use of the following integrations to sync environment variables:

- [Supabase](https://vercel.com/marketplace/supabase)
- [Sentry](https://vercel.com/marketplace/sentry)
- [BetterStack](https://vercel.com/marketplace/betterstack)
