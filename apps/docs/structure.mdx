description: How Eververse's codebase is structured.
---

`next-forge` is a monorepo, which means it contains multiple packages in a single repository. This is a common pattern for modern web applications, as it allows you to share code between different parts of the application, and manage them all together.

The monorepo is managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), which is a tool for managing monorepos. It provides a simple way to manage multiple packages in a single repository, and is designed to work with modern web applications.

The monorepo contains the following apps:

| App | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `adf-validator` | The ADF validator, which helps validate Atlassian Document Format (ADF) schemas. |
| `api` | The API, which contains serverless functions designed to run separately from the main app e.g. webhooks and cron jobs. |
| `app` | The main, which contains the Next.js app. |
