## Welcome

Use the Eververse API to interact with your Eververse data programmatically. The Eververse API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Eververse API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new API Key in your Settings, then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs.

## Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Eververse API. You can do this by providing your API Key in the `Authorization` header.

## Errors

Eververse uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was omitted).
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Eververse’s servers (these are rare).
