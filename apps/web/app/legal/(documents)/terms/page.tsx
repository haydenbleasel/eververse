    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The intellectual property in the materials contained in this website are
      owned by or licensed to Eververse and are protected by applicable
      copyright and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download one
      copy of the materials for personal, non-commercial transitory use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This
      license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
      restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by Eververse
      at any time.
    </p>
    <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
      You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over content you
      submit to us for publication on our website. We will never claim ownership
      of your content, but we do require a license from you in order to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use our website or its associated services to post, upload,
      share, or otherwise transmit content covered by intellectual property
      rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
      sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, distribute, modify, run, copy,
      publicly display, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of your
      content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy preferences and
      our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting your
      content or account. However, to the extent that we (or our partners) have
      used your content in connection with commercial or sponsored content, the
      license will continue until the relevant commercial or post has been
      discontinued by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      You give us permission to use your username and other identifying
      information associated with your account in a manner that is consistent
      with your privacy preferences, and our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as is'
      basis. To the extent permitted by law, Eververse makes no warranties,
      expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
      warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions
      of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement
      of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no event shall Eververse or its suppliers be liable for any
      consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising
      from the use or inability to use this website or the materials on this
      website, even if Eververse or an authorized representative has been
      notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any
      consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit,
      loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss
      of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or
      loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort
      (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
      or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
      limitations may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Severance</h2>
    <p>
      Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void or
      unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void or unenforceable.
      The validity of the remainder of these Terms of Service is not affected.
